## üìÇ Projects Inside

### 1. [Multi-Threaded Chat Server](./chat-server)
- Implements a **concurrent TCP chat server** supporting multiple clients.  
- Uses **multi-threading** to handle simultaneous connections.  
- Features:
  - Client join/leave notifications  
  - Broadcast messaging  
  - Graceful client disconnect handling

### 2. [DNS Resolver](./dns-resolver)
- Implements a **custom DNS resolver** at the application level.  
- Handles domain name lookups and returns resolved IP addresses.  
- Features:
  - Query parsing and response formatting  
  - Support for multiple record types (A, AAAA, CNAME)  
  - Basic caching mechanism for repeated queries

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **C / C++ / Python** (depending on project implementation)  
- Socket Programming  
- Multi-threading / Concurrency  
- Networking protocols (TCP, UDP, DNS)
